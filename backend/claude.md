# HeSocial Backend Fix - Load More Events Issue

## Problem
The "載入更多活動" (Load More Events) button on the frontend was not working because:

1. **Missing API Integration**: The frontend was only showing mock data and not connecting to the backend API
2. **Past Event Dates**: The seed data contained events from December 2024, which are in the past, so the API query `WHERE e.date_time > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` returned no results

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (`../frontend/src/pages/EventsPage.tsx`)
- Added axios for API calls
- Added state management for events, loading, and pagination
- Connected to backend API at `http://localhost:5000/api/events`
- Implemented actual "Load More Events" functionality with click handler
- Added fallback to mock data if API fails
- Added loading states and proper error handling

### 2. Database Changes (`../database/duckdb-seed.sql`)
- Updated event dates from 2024 to 2025 (future dates)
- Added 3 additional events for better testing of pagination
- Events now span from July 2025 to September 2025

### 3. Database Technology Note
- Using **DuckDB** (not SQLite)
- DuckDB is an embedded analytical database
- Connection managed through `src/database/duckdb-connection.ts`
- Database file: `../hesocial.duckdb`

## API Endpoints Working
- `GET /api/events` - Returns paginated events with filters
- `GET /api/events/categories` - Returns event categories  
- `GET /api/events/venues` - Returns venues
- `GET /api/events/:id` - Returns specific event details

## Testing Results
- Backend API properly returns JSON with pagination
- Frontend now connects to backend and loads events
- "Load More Events" button works with proper pagination
- Fallback to mock data if backend is unavailable

## Database Reinitialization Needed
To apply the updated seed data with future-dated events, the database needs to be reinitialized. The backend automatically handles this when it detects the database needs setup.

## Current Status
✅ Frontend and backend are both running
✅ API endpoints are working
✅ Load More Events functionality implemented
✅ Database contains future-dated test events
✅ API pagination working correctly
✅ Frontend connects to backend API
✅ "載入更多活動" button now functional
✅ Debug routes added for troubleshooting
✅ Enhanced seed data with 6 test events

## Test Results
- Backend API returns 6 test events with proper pagination
- Frontend limit set to 2 events per page for testing
- "Load More Events" button appears when hasMore is true
- Clicking button loads next page of events
- Events are properly appended to existing list
- Loading states work correctly
- Debug routes provide database inspection capabilities

## Final Resolution
The "載入更多活動" (Load More Events) issue has been completely resolved:

1. **Frontend Issues Fixed**:
   - Added proper API integration with axios
   - Implemented pagination state management
   - Added click handler for load more button
   - Added loading states and error handling

2. **Backend Issues Fixed**:
   - API endpoints were already working correctly
   - Added test data with future dates (2025)
   - Pagination working with proper query parameters

3. **Database Issues Fixed**:
   - Updated seed data with future dates (2025)
   - 6 test events now available spanning July-September 2025
   - Events properly linked to venues, categories, and users
   - Added debug routes for database troubleshooting

## Recent Updates (Latest Commit)
- Added comprehensive debug routes (`/api/debug/*`) for database inspection
