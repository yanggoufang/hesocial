# Unimplemented Features Analysis

This document outlines the unimplemented features identified from the console logs on July 7, 2025.

## 1. User-Facing Features (High Priority)

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/registrations/user`
*   **Impact:** The "My Registrations" page is completely broken. Users cannot see the events they have registered for.
*   **Reason:** The backend has no route to handle this request, so it returns a `501 Not Implemented` error.
*   **Priority:** **Critical**. This is a core feature for users to manage their event participation. It should be implemented as soon as possible.

## 2. Admin & System Health Features (Medium Priority)

*   **Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /api/system/health`
    *   `GET /api/system/health/detailed`
    *   `GET /api/system/metrics`
    *   `GET /api/system/diagnostics`
*   **Impact:** The "System Health" dashboard in the admin panel is not functioning. Administrators cannot monitor the health and performance of the application.
*   **Reason:** The backend has no routes to handle these requests, so it returns `501 Not Implemented` errors for all of them.
*   **Priority:** **Medium**. While not critical for the end-user experience, these are important for administrators to maintain the platform. They should be implemented after the user-facing features are working.

## Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Priority:** Implement the `GET /api/registrations/user` endpoint to fix the "My Registrations" page.
2.  **Next Priority:** Implement the four system health endpoints to make the admin dashboard functional.
